            <h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>        <p>I am a postgraduate student from the University of Limpopo currently completing a Work Readiness 4IR technologies bootcamp sponsored by Accenture with the University of Johannesburg. I have acquired a variety of team-oriented skills, and I believe that enthusiasm, integrity, accountability, and proper work etiquette are among my best qualities. Technically, I have the skill set to fit into a quantitative role in any financial institution. I pride myself on being a quick learner who can effectively contribute to team work and complete individual tasks.</p>
